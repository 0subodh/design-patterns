Gamma Categorization
- design patterns are typically split into three categories
- this is called Gamma catgorization after Erich Gama, one of GoF authors

Creational patterns
- deal with creation(construction) of objects
- explicit(constructor) vs implicit(DI, reflection,etc.)
- wholesale(single statement) vs. piecewise(step-by-step)

Structural patterns
- concerned with the structure(eg. class members)
- many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
- stress the importance of good API design

Behavioral patterns
- they are different; no central theme
